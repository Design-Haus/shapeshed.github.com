## Description

Internet Explorer 6 was released on August 27, 2001. Almost eight years later the web has moved on but Internet Explorer is still widely used, especially in corporate environments. It is time that users were encouraged to upgrade from Internet Explorer.

Don't like the style? You can override the styles of the notice with your own custom CSS. The following elements can be styled:

* \#ie6-notice - the div containing the notice
* \#ie6-notice p#ie6-text - the paragraph containing the notice text
* \#ie6-notice p#ie6-hide-notice a - the hide this notice link
