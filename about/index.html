<h1>About</h1>
<h2>About the author</h2>
<p>George Ornbo is a freelance developer based in London, UK. He has been hacking around the web professionally for over 7 years.</p> 
<p>When he's not using <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> he'll probably be cycling, watching cricket, dreaming of England or drinking tea.</p> 

<h2>About this site</h2>
<p>The site was created using Jekyll, HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.</p>

<h3>Jekyll</h3>
<p><a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll is a simple</a>, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server.<p>

<h3>CSS3</h3>
<p>CSS3 offers designers many new possibilities. Some browser vendors have implemented large parts of CSS3, whilst others haven't. You can find out more about CSS3 over at <a href="http://www.css3.info/">www.css3.info</a>.</p>

<h3>HTML5</h3>
<p>HTML 5 is the next major revision of HTML, the core markup language of the World Wide Web. It offers authors the opportunity to mark up pages more semantically and brings new APIs to the browser. You can learn more about HTML5 <a href="http://html5doctor.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">here</a></p>

<h3>jQuery</h3>
<p>jQuery is a nifty JavaScript library that takes most of the pain out of cross-browser JavaScript development. You can find out more from the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/">jQuery documentation</a> or at <a href="http://jqueryfordesigners.com/">jQuery for Designers</a>.
